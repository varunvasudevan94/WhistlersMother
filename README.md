# WhistlersMother
Simple app to count pressure cooker whistles.  

Does your mom ask you to remember the number of whistles by the pressure cooker,  
and five minutes later you realise you don't remember it ?????  
[Then you get stone cold looks].  

# How to use ?
1. Open the open [Can be downloaded from here].
2. Place the phone somewhere safe near the cooker.
3. Counter will increase automatically !!!

# How does it work ?
Simple idea tap the noise generated by the whistles (I wanted to explore react-native-audio)  
and increment the counter based on anamoly.

# Caveats
Need some more calibration with tapping noise (maybe some models might help us here !!!!),
small amounts of spam/ham might cause counter to increase (take the counter value as approximate)

# Todos
Built it in 2-3 hours so lots of todos 
1. Add more screens to allow user to set threshold instead of hardcoding.
2. Release in android/ios
3. Use better models to estimate it was a whistle by the pressure cooker.
4. Add more features like alarm.


Whistlekku na guarantee !!!!
